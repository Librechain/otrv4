# OTR version 4: Standalone Mode

[ADR 10](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/tree/master/architecture-decisions/010-modes.md)
defines the need for specifying alternative modes for the OTR protocol
version 4.

This document describes the version 4 of the Off-the-Record Messaging protocol,
in an operation mode that aims to provide an always encrypted mode with higher
security properties than OTRv3. This mode will be referred as the "standalone
mode".

The 'OTRv4-Standalone' mode is an always encrypted mode. It does not know how to
handle any kind of plaintext messages, including query messages and whitespace
tags. It supports both interactive and non-interactive conversations. It is not
backwards compatible with OTRv3.

## Mode description

An implementation of the OTRv4 protocol in a OTRv4-Standalone mode must be
compliant with the overall protocol specification
[OTRv4 Protocol](../otrv4.md#table-of-contents), with the following exceptions
and the following changes.

Ignore these sections:

- "User requests to start an OTR conversation", including "Query Messages" and
  "Whitespace Tags".
- "Requesting conversation with older OTR versions".
- "Receiving plaintext without the whitespace tag".
- "Receiving plaintext with the whitespace tag".
- "Receiving a Query Message".
- "OTRv3 Specific Encoded Messages".
- "OTRv3 Protocol State Machine".

The specification for this mode, as compared with the overall version, will
differ in these sections:

- "High Level Overview": there is not a "Requests OTR conversation" step.
- "Conversation started by an Interactive DAKE": the conversation begins when
  a participant sends an Identity message. In this mode, there is no
  advertisement of which version a participant supports as both parties
  only support OTRv4.
- "Creating a Client Profile": the `Versions` field must only allow the 1-byte
  version string "4".
- "Creating a Client Profile": the `Transitional Signature` field is not allowed
  in this mode: there is no DSA signature generation or verification. Therefore,
  when validating a Client Profile, the DSA signature must not be verified.
- "Establishing Versions": ignore the paragraph: "A compliant OTRv4
  implementation is required to support version 3 of OTR, but not versions 1 and
  2". This mode only allows version 4 of the protocol.
- "Online Conversation Initialization": ignore everything that refers to query
  messages and whitespace tags. Always check that the compatible version in the
  participant's Client Profile includes "4".
- "Offline Conversation Initialization": always check that the compatible
  version in the participant's Client Profile includes "4".
- "Fragmentation": only OTRv4 fragmentation is allowed. Ignore this paragraph:
  "For fragmentation in OTRv3, refer to the "Fragmentation" section on OTRv3
  specification".
- "Protocol states": the `START` and `FINISHED` states of the protocol state
  machine should not allow any plaintext message to be sent, since plaintext
  messages are not allowed in this mode.

Online OTRv4 conversations in this mode are initialized by sending an Identity
Message, as defined in the
[Starting a conversation interactively](../otrv4.md#starting-a-conversation-interactively)
section.

### Interactive DAKE Overview in OTRv4-Standalone Mode

```
Alice                                           Bob
---------------------------------------------------
       Identity message -------->
       <------------------------------------ Auth-R
       Auth-I --------------------------------->
```

Alice will be initiating the DAKE with Bob.

**Alice:**

1. Generates an Identity message, as defined in
   [Identity Message](../otrv4.md#identity-message) section.
1. Sets `Y` and `y` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
1. Sets `B` as  and `b` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
1. Sends Bob the Identity message with her `our_ecdh_first.public`
   and `our_dh_first.public` attached.

**Bob:**

1. Receives an Identity message from Alice:
    * Verifies the Identity message as defined in the
      [Identity message](#identity-message) section. If the verification fails
      (for example, if Alice's public keys -`Y` or `B`- are not valid), rejects
      the message and does not send anything further.
    * Sets `Y` as `their_ecdh`.
    * Sets `B` as `their_dh`.
    * Sets the received `our_ecdh_first.public` from Alice as `their_ecdh_first`.
    * Sets the received `our_dh_first.public` from Alice as `their_dh_first`.
1. Generates an Auth-R message, as defined in
   [Auth-R Message](../otrv4.md#auth-r-message) section.
1. Sets `X` and `x` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
1. Sets `A` and `a` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
1. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
    * Calculates ECDH shared secret
      `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_ecdh.secret`.
    * Calculates DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`.
    * Calculates the brace key `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      Securely deletes `k_dh`.
    * Calculates the Mixed shared secret
      `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret ||K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
      Securely deletes `K_ecdh` and `brace_key`.
    * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: the first 8 bytes of
      `HWC(usage_SSID || K, 64)`.
1. Sends Alice the Auth-R message (see [Auth-R Message](../otrv4.md#auth-r-message)
   section) with his `our_ecdh_first.public` and `our_dh_first.public` attached.

**Alice:**

1. Receives the Auth-R message from Bob:
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed on Alice's profile, and follows
     the specification for this version. If the versions are incompatible, Bob
     does not send any further messages.
1. Verifies the Auth-R message as defined in the
   [Auth-R Message](../otrv4.md#auth-r-message) section. If the verification fails
   (for example, if Bob's public keys -`X` or `A`- are not valid), rejects
   the message and does not send anything further.
   * Sets `X` as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets `A` as `their_dh`.
   * Sets the received `our_ecdh_first.public` from Alice as `their_ecdh_first`.
   * Sets the received `our_dh_first.public` from Alice as `their_dh_first`.
1. Creates an Auth-I message (see [Auth-I Message](../otrv4.md#auth-i-message)
   section).
1. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
    * Calculates ECDH shared secret
      `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_ecdh.secret`, `our_ecdh.public` and `their_ecdh`.
      Replaces them with:
      * `our_ecdh.secret = our_ecdh_first.secret`.
      * `our_ecdh.public = our_ecdh_first.public`.
      * `their_ecdh = their_ecdh_first`.
      * Securely deletes `our_ecdh_first.secret`, `our_ecdh_first.public` and
        `their_ecdh_first`.
    * Calculates DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`, `our_dh.public` and `their_dh`.
      Replaces them with:
      * `our_dh.secret = our_dh_first.secret`.
      * `our_dh.public = our_dh_first.public`.
      * `their_dh = their_dh_first`.
      * Securely deletes `our_dh_first.secret`, `our_dh_first.public` and
        `their_dh_first`.
    * Calculates the brace key `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      Securely deletes `k_dh`.
    * Calculates the Mixed shared secret
      `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
      Securely deletes `k_ecdh` and `brace_key`.
    * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: the first 8 bytes of
      `HWC(usage_SSID || K, 64)`.
1. Initializes the double-ratchet:
    * Sets `i`, `j`, `k` `pn` as 0.
    * Sets `max_remote_i_seen` as -1.
    * Interprets `K` as the first root key (`prev_root_key`) by:
      `KDF(usage_first_root_key || K, 64)`.
    * Calculates the receiving keys:
      * Calculates `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      * Calculates `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      * Calculates `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      * Securely deletes `k_dh`.
      * Calculates the Mixed shared secret (and replaces the old value)
        `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`. Securely
        deletes `K_ecdh`.
      * Derives new set of keys:
        `curr_root_key, chain_key_r[k] = derive_ratchet_keys(receiving, prev_root_key, K)`.
      * Securely deletes the previous root key (`prev_root_key`) and `K`.
    * Calculates the sending keys:
      * Generates a new ECDH key pair and assigns it to
        `our_ecdh = generateECDH()` (by securely replacing the old value).
      * Calculates `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      * Generates the new DH key pair and assigns it to
        `our_dh = generateDH()` (by securely replacing the old value).
      * Calculates `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      * Calculates `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      * Securely deletes `k_dh`.
      * Calculates the Mixed shared secret (and replaces the old value)
        `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`. Securely
        deletes `K_ecdh`.
     * Interprets `curr_root_key` as `prev_root_key`.
      * Derives new set of keys:
        `curr_root_key, chain_key_s[j] = derive_ratchet_keys(sending, prev_root_key, K)`.
      * Securely deletes the previous root key (`prev_root_key`) and `K`.
      * Increments `i = i + 1`.
1. Sends Bob the Auth-I message (see [Auth-I message](#auth-i-message)
   section).
1. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Alice:
   * In the case that he wants to immediately send a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section.
       Note that he will not perform a new DH ratchet, but rather start using
       the derived `chain_key_s[j]`. She should follow the
       "When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:" subsection.
   * In the case that she receives a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message)
       section. Note that he will use the already derived `chain_key_r[k]`.
       She should follow the "Try to decrypt the message with a stored skipped
       message key" or "When receiving a data message in the same DH Ratchet:"
       subsections.

**Bob:**

1. Receives the Auth-I message from Alice:
   * Verifies the Auth-I message as defined in the
     [Auth-I Message](../otrv4.md#auth-i-message) section. If the verification
     fails, rejects the message and does not send anything further.
1. Initializes the double-ratchet algorithm:
   * Sets `i`, `j`, `k` and `pn` as 0.
   * Sets `max_remote_i_seen` as -1.
   * Interprets `K` as the first root key (`prev_root_key`) by:
     `KDF(usage_first_root_key || K, 64)`.
   * Securely deletes `our_ecdh.public` and `their_ecdh`.
     Replaces them with:
       * `our_ecdh.secret = our_ecdh_first.secret`.
       * `our_ecdh.public = our_ecdh_first.public`.
       * `their_ecdh = their_ecdh_first`.
       * Securely deletes `our_ecdh_first.secret`, `our_ecdh_first.public` and
         `their_ecdh_first`.
   * Securely deletes `our_dh.public` and `their_dh`. Replaces them with:
       * `our_dh.secret = our_dh_first.secret`.
       * `our_dh.public = our_dh_first.public`.
       * `their_dh = their_dh_first`.
       * Securely deletes `our_dh_first.secret`, `our_dh_first.public` and
         `their_dh_first`.
   * Calculates the sending keys:
      * Calculates `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      * Calculates `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      * Calculates `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      * Securely deletes `k_dh`.
      * Calculates the Mixed shared secret (and replaces the old value):
        `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`. Securely
        deletes `K_ecdh`.
      * Derives new set of keys:
        `curr_root_key, chain_key_s[j] = derive_ratchet_keys(sending, prev_root_key, K)`.
      * Securely deletes the previous root key (`prev_root_key`) and `K`.
1. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Bob:
   * In the case that he wants to immediately send a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section.
       Note that he will use the already derived `chain_key_s[j]`. She should
       follow the "When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:"
       subsection.
   * In the case that he immediately receives a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you receive a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section.
       Note that he will perform a new DH ratchet with the advertised keys
       from Alice attached in the message. If he wants to send data
       messages at this point, he will perform a new DH ratchet as well.

### Scenarios and applications

This mode might work on this kind of applications and scenarios:

#### Scenario A: an OTRv4-Standalone WhatsApp-like application

Alice wants to send a message to Bob.

1. Alice adds Bob as a contact:
   * A DAKE (interactive or non-interactive depending on the contact's
     availability) is immediately executed. The long-term key material is stored
     in the device for later use.
   * Identity verification is still necessary even if the app uses a 'Trust On
     First Use' (TOFU) policy.
2. Alice types messages, encrypts them and "sends them" to Bob.
   * Every message exchanged will always be encrypted.
   * Instance tags could be optional in this "one device per contact" model,
     unless the user has logged in from the same account in different devices.
   * Fragmentation will be optional.
3. Bob receives the encrypted messages from Alice.

There is no exchange of plaintext messages in this scenario.

#### Scenario B: an OTRv4-Standalone Pidgin-like application

Alice wants to send a message to Bob.

1. Alice adds Bob as a contact
2. Alice verifies Bob's identity. She either:
   * Uses Bob's Client Profile and verifies Bob's fingerprint using a business
     card, a HTTPS website, or other.
   * If Bob is online, she performs a interactive DAKE and uses the Socialist
     Millionaires Protocol.
2. Alice types a messages and "sends them" to Bob.
   * A DAKE (either online or offline) is performed, if the application is not
     already in an encrypted state.
   * Alice is warned about any problem to establish an encrypted channel and/or
     any problem with the identity verification from Bob.
   * Instance tags are required because there may be multiple devices.
   * Fragmentation could be optional depending on the network.
3. Bob receives the message from Alice.

If the network allows Alice to receive messages from devices not on the same
mode, plaintext messages may arrive. Such messages should be handled by the
application, and not by the OTRv4 protocol in this mode. If the application
allows Alice to send plaintext messages, they should be directly delivered to
Bob by the application and not by the OTRv4 protocol in this mode.

## Considerations

Plaintext messages are not allowed in conversations in OTRv4-Standalone mode.
This means that query messages and whitespace tags are not allowed in this mode.

By always requiring encryption, this mode may encourage long-lived sessions.
The section [Session Expiration](../otrv4.md#session-expiration) of the OTRv4
protocol specification outlines how to mitigate the risks of long-lived
sessions. TLVs type 1 (Disconnected) can still be necessary in this mode.

Furthermore, as this mode always requires encryption, the protocol can get stuck
if, for example, a DAKE message is lost and never delivered. This document does
not define any strategy, like a timeout, for dealing with such cases; but
implementers are recommended to do so.

Even though there is no need to prefix OTR messages with the five bytes "?OTR:",
since the protocol only handles OTR messages, this mode does not modify this
encoding for convenience.

This mode is compliant with the security properties described in the
[Security Properties](../otrv4.md#security-properties) section. But, take into
account that there may be a loss of deniability if an interactive DAKE is
followed by a non-interactive one. Implementers are recommended to warn the
users about it when it happens.
